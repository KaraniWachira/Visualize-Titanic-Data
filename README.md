# Visualize-Titanic-Data 
In this project I used the Titanic Data from Kaggle to make sense out of it by visualizing it using ggplot2 package.
I did it by answering the following questions:
 i) What was the survival rate?
 ii) What was the survival rate by gender?
 iii) What was the survival rate by ticket class?
 iv) What was the survival rate by  class ticket & gender?
 v) What was the distribution of passangers by age?
 vi) What was the survival rate by age?
 vii) What is the survival rate by age when segmented by gender an class ticket?
